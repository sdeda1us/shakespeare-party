# Project Name

Shakespeare Party

## Description

_Duration: 2 weeks_

This application allows the user to select any play from the complete works of William Shakespeare and organize a performance with a group of friends. The application requires users register or log in if they are returning to the site. 

If registering, the application gives users a choice to start a new play or to join one a group member has already made. Those who originate the play have administrative access (director status) and can change the name of the acting troupe, remove performers from roles they have claimed, change who has director status in the troupe, and delete the troupe when the performance is complete. 

All players who login have access to the actor dashboard. From there, actors can claim parts, review their lines, and access the entire text of the play.
